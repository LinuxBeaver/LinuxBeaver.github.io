Hello, My name is Linux beaver and I make GEGL based GIMP Plugins that style text and do workflows relating to cards, banners and Youtube thumbnails. The goal of my GIMP plugins is to help make above described workflows easier on users. This Github.io page was made to simplify the process of users interacting with my Github pages as before it was much more complicated. As in example each plugin had individual repos with 100 individual Github pages, futher more many plugins shared dependencies plugins. As a result it become confusing for end users. Now I am trying to simplify everything with this webpage that will link everything needed for the users. The user will be able to see a preview of my plugin on the webpage, click and download the binaries or follow instructions to go into the main folder and get its source code by running 

```
grab_code.sh
```


grab.code.sh will be ran in a individual folder, which will give you the source code of that plugin and all its dependencies.

 Currently as of November 2024 there will be 90+ main folders for all the plugins and some plugins like "bevel" that is a frequent dependency will only have one folder but grab_code.sh inside a plugin folder that depends on bevel will zip bevel's code alongside the plugin's code that needs bevel.
